  Hello there!  /\_/\   This responsive, interactive
               ( o.o )    portfolio website was created 
                >^|^<       by Fox Jones on December 15, 2022 @ 10:03 PM

  Thank you for taking the time to review my code.
  Since you asked, Yes! This page was handcoded by yours truly.
  What's that, you want to know more? I thought you'd never ask!
  We don't get too many visitors round these parts, but when we do...
  Well, they tend to be the curious type! Is that you?
  Well then let me tell you a tale...

  The entire portfolio exists as a single 3.61 KB HTMl file,
  and uses TailwindCSS for style and CSS micro-animations/
  Did I write all this code from scratch? Heck no. I wrote
  about 75% of it, and then borrowed and modified public code
  snippits for adding various functionality, like the darkmode
  switch.

  I began in Codepen.io for some rapid prototyping,
  then created a Git repo and connected VSCode.
  Finally, I grabbed some sweet HD images from Unsplash
  (credit to the photographers in the filename.jpg)
  I hope that answers all your questions! The rest of the code
  is throughly commented for your convenience and mine. 
  
  Please make yourself at home, and take a look around.
